In a <a>previous post</a> I commented about the moles we brought back from our trip to Ensenada. This is one of the possible presentations for the most unknown of them: the fruit mole. Well, after a bit of <a href="https://www.myfoodandfamily.com/es-US/recipe/116102/lomo-de-cerdo-envuelto-en-tocino-con-mole-de-frutas">investigation</a> my suspicions were true and it does go well with pork meat, hence the loins. What follows here is a pictorial of how we prepared and presented the dish accompanied by red rice and corn tortillas.

As if it were some illegal substance, the mole! (powder form)

According to my brother, it takes a 2:1 ratio of tomato sauce to mole powder to reach a nice pastey consistency to which you add the stock
