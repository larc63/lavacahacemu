Thanks to groupon, once again, we visited a seldom mentioned place right in the heart of Dallas, or, maybe the spleen of Dallas, depending on what angle you see it from; fact is, it's in Dallas' fair park near downtown and it hosts a fair amount of cars, the lighting could definitely be better if you plan on taking pictures, but hey, they LET YOU take pictures, most museums don't. Mais enfin, this is part 1 of, I don't know how many parts yet.. Â
